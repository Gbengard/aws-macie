# Scanning S3 for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using Macie

## Overview

This GitHub project aims to demonstrate the usage of Amazon Macie for scanning S3 buckets to identify and report Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The project also sets up alerts through EventBridge and SNS for immediate notification.

The implementation described here is specific to the us-east-1 region. Please make sure to adjust the instructions according to your deployment region.

It's important to note that Macie is free for 30 days, and as long as you disable it before the trial ends, there will be no charges incurred.

## Example Data

## Instructions

### Stage 1 - Uploading Example Data to S3

1. Save the provided example data as separate text files on your local machine.
2. Access the S3 console using the following link: [https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets).
3. Click on "Create bucket" to create a new S3 bucket.
4. Choose a name for the bucket and select the appropriate region (ensure it matches the Macie setup region).
5. Leave all other options as default and click "Create bucket."

Note: The region chosen for the bucket must match the region configured for Macie.

6. Upload the example data files to the S3 bucket you just created. You can either upload them directly to the root of the bucket or organize them into subdirectories.

Optional: If you prefer to upload the files via the command line to random subdirectories, you can use the following AWS CLI command (ensure you have [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) set up):

	```bash
	$ ls -1 *.txt
	cc.txt
	employees.txt
	keys.txt
	plates.txt

	$ for x in $(ls -1 *.txt); do aws s3 cp ${x} s3://BUCKET_NAME/$RANDOM/$RANDOM/$RANDOM/${x}; done
	upload: ./cc.txt to s3://BUCKET_NAME/1340/7073/9841/cc.txt
	upload: ./employees.txt to s3://BUCKET_NAME/15772/21602/11992/employees.txt
	upload: ./keys.txt to s3://BUCKET_NAME/26039/27331/32227/keys.txt
	upload: ./plates.txt to s3://BUCKET_NAME/14373/22304/25075/plates.txt
	```

### Stage 2 - Enabling Amazon Macie

1. Access the Macie console using the following link: [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/macie/home?region=us-east-1#getStarted](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/macie/home?region=us-east-1#getStarted).
2. After clicking on "Getting started," the initial screen will provide an introduction to Macie, including the creation of a service-linked role for Macie's S3 scanning capabilities.
3. Click on "Enable Macie" to enable the service.
4. Allow a few minutes for Macie to become ready. Refresh the page until you see the Macie dashboard.

6. On the "Review S3 buckets" page, click "Next."

7. On the "Refine the scope" page, select "One-time job" and click "Next."

8. Leave the "Managed data identifier options" set to "All" and click "Next."

9. Since there are no "Custom data identifiers" at this stage, click "Next."

10. On the "Select allow lists" page, click "Next."

11. Set a suitable "Job name" and click "Next."

12. Verify all the settings and details, and then click "Confirm."

Note: The job may take up to 20 minutes to complete. Once it's finished, you can click "Show results" and then "Show findings."

13. You should see that the Credit Card, Employee, and Financial files have been detected as containing PII.

## Stage 3 - SNS Setup

To set up SNS for your project, follow these steps:

1. Access the SNS console by navigating to [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home?region=us-east-1#/topics](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home?region=us-east-1#/topics).

2. Click on the "Create topic" button.

3. Set the "Type" to "Standard" and name the topic as "Macie-Alerts".

4. In the "Access policy" section, keep the method as "Basic".

5. Configure the "Define who can publish messages to the topic" option to allow only specified AWS accounts. Enter your account ID, which can be found in the top right corner of the screen.

6. Similarly, configure the "Define who can subscribe to this topic" option to allow only specified AWS accounts. Enter your account ID again.

Note: In a production environment, it is advisable to further restrict access to only the necessary resources for publishing to the topic. However, for this temporary setup example, limiting access to the AWS account is sufficient and secure.

7. Keep all other options as default and click on the "Create topic" button.

8. On the next page, click on the "Create subscription" button.

9. Under the "Topic ARN", choose the sns topic created, which is "Macie-Alerts"

9. Change the "Protocol" to "Email".

10. In the "Endpoint" field, enter your personal email address.

11. Click the "Create subscription" button.

12. Shortly after, you will receive a confirmation email. Click on the link provided in the email to confirm your subscription. This step ensures that SNS can deliver emails to your specified endpoint and helps prevent spam.

Side note: While writing this, it was observed that the confirmation email sometimes goes to the Spam folder in Gmail. Please check your Spam folder if you don't receive the confirmation email in your inbox.

Once confirmed, your subscription should be in the "Confirmed" state as shown below:
